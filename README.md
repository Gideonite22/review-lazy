# Review Lazy: Collaborative Observation Validation Platform

## Overview

Review Lazy is a decentralized blockchain-based platform designed to facilitate peer-validated astronomical observations. By leveraging the Stacks blockchain, Review Lazy creates a transparent, immutable registry where amateur astronomers can record, share, and validate celestial observations.

### Core Value Proposition

- **Permanent Record**: Secure, tamper-proof documentation of astronomical discoveries
- **Community Validation**: Peer-review mechanism for astronomical observations
- **Achievement Tracking**: Gamified recognition for consistent observers

## Key Features

- üì° Detailed celestial observation logging
- üèÖ Achievement badge system
- üåê Blockchain-verified observations
- üë• Community-driven validation process

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Clarinet
- Stacks wallet
- Basic astronomical observation knowledge

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with Clarinet
3. Deploy the smart contract
4. Initialize the platform

### Example Usage

```clarity
;; Register as an astronomer
(contract-call? .review-lazy register-astronomer "StarTracker")

;; Record an observation
(contract-call? .review-lazy record-observation 
    "Andromeda Galaxy" 
    "Galaxy" 
    "00h 42m 44.3s" 
    "+41¬∞ 16' 9"" 
    "Remote Observatory" 
    "Excellent" 
    "Clear Skies" 
    "8-inch Reflector" 
    "Detailed spiral structure visible" 
    none)
```

## Security Considerations

- Community-driven verification process
- Blockchain immutability
- No self-verification allowed
- Transparent achievement tracking
